So, I'm going to make a tic tac toe game...

1. Begin by setting up the project on github

2. Create files
	a. html
	b. css
	c. js

3. Begin by making the js for the console
	a. Create gameboard object (3x3)
		i. Set up board as an array with empty cells, update the board, reset the board etc
	b. Create player objects
		i. Name, marker, etc
	c. Create gameplay object
		i. Players/who goes first, start game, gameboard creation, current player choice, ensure cell is empty, change player, play round, check for winning combos, check fordraw, reset if winner found/else continue
	d. Create board object to display on screen
		i. Use dom manipulation like with etch a sketch
4. Set up the html
	a. Keep it simple
		i. Bit like etch a sketch again
5. Set up css
	a. Make it look decent
		i. Ensure its clean and works properly

Link it all together, test it works and think about fancier features like user name, reset btn, display game results etc.
